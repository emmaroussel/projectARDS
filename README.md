Individual READMEs are provided in each folder. 
**circuitMice** folder contains mice data and code to estimate the alveolar proportions. Variable compliance with pressure (variable capacitors) is implemented.
**circuitMock** contains code to generate synthetic data and estimate alveolar proportions for such data. Variable compliance with pressure is not implemented.
